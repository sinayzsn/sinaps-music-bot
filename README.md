# Music Sorter

# About

The point of this bot is to sort the music that you have in the telegram. 

For example I have 5 Genres that I would usually listen to: Rock, Country, Rap, Metal, Pop.
And this bot would receive the musics and would sort them out in a super group that has Topics
enabled. Like I have a super group called sorter and it has all the genres as a topic and when 
the bo would receive an audio file it would ask you to select a genre for that audio, after that
it will forward the music to the related topic that is named after that genre.
